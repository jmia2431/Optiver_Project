    "Financial markets are complicated systems where participants buy or sell financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, derivatives, currencies and commodities, through a structured marketplace under regulatory oversight. Financial data provides a rich environment for data analysis through the investigation of market research, investment strategies, risk management, algorithmic trading, and predictive modelling. An order book provides one instance of a relatively simplistic dataset conveying the bid-ask prices and sizes of particular stocks at a given moment in the market. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) market makers like Optiver provide liquidity in the market to make small amounts of profit over large volumes of trades. For these trading firms, capturing price fluctuations of the products being traded is invaluable for their profits; through this report, we discuss the impact of feature engineering and clustering on the performance of model predictions.\n",

    "To develop more variables for our models in addition to the attributes in the stock datasets, we applied feature engineering on the bid and ask prices and sizes, creating various measures of spreads for the time ids. Through this, we compare our optimised linear regression model with a baseline linear model. The feature engineering variables were also used in our tree based models, Light GBM and Random Forest. Comparatively, time series models like GARCH and ARIMA were also developed. These various models were developed and compared to determine the prediction of volatility with the highest accuracy whilst reducing the error rate.\n",
